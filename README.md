# Tick-Tack-Toe
I have implemented the classic game of Tick Tack Toe

## About

I have used the command line to ask the users for the coordinates of their moves and then printing them in a 9x9 board. The user has the option of playing the game with another user (a two-player game) or to play with the computer (using Artificial Intelligence). When playing with the computer, the user has the option to play with a beginner AI that uses random moves, an intermediate AI that makes winning moves and prevents losing moves, and a trained AI that never loses (using Minimax Algorithm, optimized using Alpha-Beta pruning).

## Importance

This is my first ever project in which I have incorporated algorithms from the branch of Artificial Intelligence. I desire to have a career in AI or ML and this project helps jump-start it.
